# get the function offset and jump to the function at runtime dynamically

> can you give me an example of get the function offset and jump to the function at runtime dynamically(not get the function pointer at compile)? think step by step and do it

It's a little bit unusual to want to find a function's offset in an executable and then jump to it at runtime, but it's technically feasible. This might be used in some very specific scenarios such as custom linker/loader or debugging/profiling tools development.

For instance, you can create a simple ELF parser to find a function's offset in an executable file, and then create a function pointer at runtime to call this function. Here is a basic example:

1. **Compile your program with debug symbols and without ASLR**: This will make your task a lot easier.

   ```bash
   gcc -g -fno-pie -no-pie main.c -o myprogram
   ```

2. **Create an ELF parser to find the function's offset**: This can be quite complex, but here is a simple example using the `readelf` tool and some scripting:

   ```bash
   readelf -s myprogram | grep ' my_function' | awk '{print $2}'
   ```

   This command will print the offset of `my_function` in `myprogram`.

3. **Create a function pointer at runtime**: In your program, you can create a function pointer to the function using its offset. This will require some casting, since you cannot directly assign an integer to a function pointer in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void my_function() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}

int main() {
    uintptr_t func_offset = 0x...; // Fill this with the actual offset

    // Cast the offset to a function pointer
    void (*func_ptr)() = (void (*)())func_offset;

    // Call the function through the pointer
    func_ptr();

    return 0;
}
```
This code will call `my_function` through a function pointer created at runtime.

**Remember**, the offset you get from readelf is the offset in the file, and your program has to be loaded at address 0 for this to work, hence disabling PIE (Position Independent Executable). 

This is a really simple example and may not work for all executables, particularly those that are more complex. Creating a robust ELF parser that can find a function's offset in any executable is a significantly more complex task.

**Please be aware** that this is considered a rather dangerous operation as it might lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes if not done properly. Therefore, it's not recommended for most applications. You should generally prefer to use function pointers that are set at compile time. The offset of a function might be different every time the program is run, due to Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). This is a security feature that's present in all modern operating systems.

These are advanced techniques and should only be used if you understand exactly what you are doing. Manipulating function pointers and offsets can easily lead to crashes, undefined behavior, or security vulnerabilities if not done properly.
